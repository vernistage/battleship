- Using a formal Agile group process to complete a successful development project.

##Summary 

A game designer has asked you to come up with a way for him and his friend to play battleship. Your mission if you choose to accept it is as follows.

##Client MVP
- Player creates game, and another player joins.
- Each player places their ships
- Players take turns firing on ships  by entering the coordinates in a text box.
- After the post, the users are taken to a page that says if they hit/miss and are held there until itâ€™s thier turn .
- Players are taken to a page that tells them they are waiting their turn.
- Game detects when there is a winner.
- After a winner is decided the users are redirected to the game show page with basic stats.

Look at the [Wikipedia description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) for the rules of the game.

##Conclusion

We paired together and wrote a Ruby on Rails application with a Javascript simulation of Battleship.
